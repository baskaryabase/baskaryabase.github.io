2. When I am occupied my own needs i would be often misunderstood
3. My need takes away all enjoyment, happiness

## What was the Need of God

`உள்ளத்துக்கும், சித்தத்திற்கும், ஏற்றபடி செய்யத்தக்க உண்மையான`  
God is talking about the nations & generationṣ

**1 Sam 12:2**  
Amidst the surrondings filled with impurity Samuel was not affected

**1 Sam 12:23**  
1. If I dont pray for others that itself a sin
2. I expect that God needs to hear my Cry, did I Ever listened to Gods Cry
3. தன் தேவையை பாராமல் தேவனின் தேவையை பார்த்த  
நன்மை ஒன்றும் இல்லாதிருந்தும்
என்னை தேடி வந்த இயேசு
