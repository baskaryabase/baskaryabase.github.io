* More people interested spiritual openess is high but spiritual maturity is lacking
    - spiritually available
* How are you growing in word, character, relationship with God
* Are you having a basic discipline with God 
* If you dont have purpose in music its an entertainment

    - Personal Intimacy
    - Relationship God leads to Commisions

## 1 Tim 6:11  
ஓடு, நாடு, போராடு

## 2 TIm 2:20  
Become the kind of container God can use to present
Run away from `Infantile indulgence`. Run after `mature righteousness`

* God wants to prepare you, Use you
* you can only produce who you are

* If you are not careful with what God has gifted you
    - You attraction/strength can lead to your destruction

* Ahimaaz - want to run, take risk, enthusiastic but has no message
    - he has the ability to run fast
    - not able to recieve the message
* Cushite - he was good observer

## Personal Comparison & Application
* I have spiritual openess and availablity but not sure what is my purpose meant for
    - to be with him(Jesus Christ)
    - to be conditioned that leads
    - to Commisions
* i want to runaway from my childish thoughts and become mature spiritually
* I want the hunger to be with God
* to be discipline in my intimacy with God
* A lot of times I was like Ahimaaz not sure what to carry
* like Cushite i want to observe things and understand the situation without someone being tell all the happenings
