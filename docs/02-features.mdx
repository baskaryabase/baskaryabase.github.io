## Key Features

### ‚öôÔ∏è Infrastructure Monitoring
Kubesense provides deep visibility into the health and performance of your Kubernetes infrastructure. With real-time insights into nodes, pods, and cluster resources, Kubesense helps you understand resource consumption patterns and identify potential bottlenecks.

- **Node and Pod Monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, and disk utilization across nodes and pods.
- **Network Monitoring**: Visualize traffic between Kubernetes resources and identify unusual network behaviors.
- **Resource Allocation**: Monitor resource usage to ensure optimal allocation and prevent over-provisioning or resource exhaustion.

### üìú Logs Management
Efficient log management is crucial for troubleshooting and compliance. Kubesense captures and organizes logs from across your Kubernetes cluster, enabling quick access and real-time search.

- **Centralized Logging**: Collect logs from all cluster components in a unified view.
- **Log Filtering and Search**: Use advanced search capabilities to locate specific log entries quickly.
- **Alerting and Notifications**: Set up alerts based on log patterns to stay informed about important events and issues.

### üöÄ Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
Kubesense provides Application Performance Monitoring to help you measure and optimize application performance at the service level.

- **Service-Level Metrics**: Gain insights into latency, throughput, and error rates for each service.
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Monitor key transactions to ensure smooth user experiences and pinpoint performance bottlenecks.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Leverage AI-driven RCA to diagnose underlying causes of performance issues without needing extensive manual investigation.

### üîç Trace Explorer
The **Trace Explorer** in Kubesense enables a granular view of distributed traces across services, making it easy to track the flow of requests and identify latency issues.

- **Trace Visualization**: View detailed trace maps to analyze request flows across services.
- **Error Tracing**: Identify failed requests and understand where errors originate within a trace.
- **Request Latency Analysis**: Drill down into each service interaction to measure latency and optimize performance.

### üåê Supported Protocols
Kubesense supports various protocols for seamless monitoring and tracing of network and service interactions.

- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Monitor and trace HTTP traffic across your services.
- **gRPC**: Track gRPC communication patterns for microservices-based applications.
- **TCP/UDP**: Capture low-level TCP/UDP communication for network analysis.
- **Database Protocols**: Compatible with popular database protocols for SQL query monitoring.

### üíª Supported Programming Languages
Kubesense is compatible with multiple programming languages commonly used in cloud-native applications.

- **Languages Supported**:
  - **Java**
  - **Node.js**
  - **Python**
  - **Go**
  - **.NET**
  
  These languages are auto-instrumented for tracing, logging, and monitoring, making it easy to achieve comprehensive observability without extensive manual setup.

### üîÑ Distributed Tracing
Kubesense‚Äôs Distributed Tracing feature provides end-to-end visibility into service requests across complex applications. Distributed tracing allows you to understand the full path of a request, including every microservice it interacts with, making it an essential tool for debugging and performance optimization.

- **End-to-End Request Tracing**: Follow requests across multiple services to analyze their path and detect latency issues.
- **Trace Aggregation**: Aggregate trace data for better analysis of request flows and performance patterns.
- **Error Identification**: Identify and troubleshoot errors in specific parts of the trace to minimize system downtime.

### üìà Service Map
The **Service Map** in Kubesense provides a visual overview of service dependencies and relationships within your Kubernetes environment.

- **Service Interactions**: See how services interact with each other in real-time.
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitor the health status of each service, including error rates and latency.
- **Dependency Mapping**: Automatically map service dependencies, helping to identify critical services and potential failure points.

### üìä Metrics
Kubesense collects and visualizes metrics at various levels, enabling precise monitoring and proactive management of resources.

- **Resource Metrics**: Collect metrics on CPU, memory, and disk usage for nodes, pods, and containers.
- **Custom Metrics**: Set up custom metrics to monitor specific aspects of your applications.
- **Real-Time Dashboards**: View metrics in real-time dashboards for quick insights into system health and performance.
- **Alerting on Thresholds**: Set threshold-based alerts on critical metrics to catch issues before they escalate.
