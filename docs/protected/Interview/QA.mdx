# **Section 4 – Selenium (Comparison & Depth)**

### **1. Difference between Selenium and Playwright**

**Answer:**
Selenium controls browsers via WebDriver protocol; Playwright uses direct browser APIs — faster, supports multiple browsers, auto-waiting, and built-in parallelism.

---

### **2. How to handle dynamic elements in Selenium**

**Answer:**
Use dynamic XPaths or explicit waits:

```java
WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, 10);
wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.id("dynamic")));
```

---

### **3. Implicit vs Explicit Waits**

**Answer:**

* **Implicit:** Applies globally for all elements.
* **Explicit:** Waits for a specific condition or element.

---

### **4. Parallel Execution in Selenium**

**Answer:**
Use **TestNG parallel execution** or **Selenium Grid** to run tests across browsers.

---

### **5. Screenshot capture on failure**

**Answer:**

```java
File src = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
FileUtils.copyFile(src, new File("error.png"));
```


# **Section 1 – Playwright**

### **1. What advantages does Playwright have over Selenium?**

**Answer:**
Playwright supports **multiple browsers (Chromium, WebKit, Firefox)** using a single API, handles **auto-waiting**, **network interception**, **tracing**, and offers **faster execution** and **built-in parallelization**.

---

### **2. How does Playwright handle auto-waiting?**

**Answer:**
Playwright automatically waits for elements to be ready before performing actions like `click()` or `fill()`, reducing flakiness without requiring explicit waits.

---

### **3. How do you handle authentication in Playwright?**

**Answer:**
Use **storage state**:

```ts
await page.context().storageState({ path: 'state.json' });
```

Reuse this state in future tests via `use: { storageState: 'state.json' }` in the config.

---

### **4. How do you capture screenshots or videos of failed tests?**

**Answer:**
Use the `screenshot` and `video` options in the Playwright config or inside test hooks:

```ts
await page.screenshot({ path: 'error.png' });
```

Enable `video: 'on'` in the config for automatic recording.

---

### **5. How do you run Playwright tests in parallel and headless mode?**

**Answer:**

* **Parallel:** Playwright Test runs specs in parallel by default; control it via `--workers`.
* **Headless:** Add `headless: true` in `browser` launch options.

---

### **6. How do you perform API testing using Playwright?**

**Answer:**
Playwright has a **request context** for HTTP calls:

```ts
const response = await request.get('https://api.example.com/users');
expect(response.ok()).toBeTruthy();
```

---

### **7. How do you perform visual regression testing in Playwright?**

**Answer:**
Use `expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('baseline.png')` to compare screenshots with a baseline image.

---

### **8. How do you intercept or mock network requests?**

**Answer:**
Use `page.route()`:

```ts
await page.route('**/api/data', route => route.fulfill({ status: 200, body: '{"mock":"data"}' }));
```

---

### **9. How do you manage test data in Playwright?**

**Answer:**
Through environment variables, JSON files, or the `test.use()` API to inject dynamic data into test contexts.

---

### **10. How do you structure a Playwright project for scalability?**

**Answer:**
Use **Page Object Model (POM)**, **fixtures** for setup/teardown, a **config file** for environments, and **tag tests** for grouping and filtering.

---

# **Section 2 – GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**

### **1. How do you run Playwright tests in GitHub Actions?**

**Answer:**
Use a workflow like:

```yaml
name: Playwright Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20 }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: npx playwright test
```

---

### **2. How do you store secrets securely?**

**Answer:**
Store tokens/credentials in **GitHub Secrets** and access them via `${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}` in workflows.

---

### **3. How can you trigger tests only when code in `/tests` changes?**

**Answer:**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'tests/**'
```

---

### **4. How do you publish Playwright test reports?**

**Answer:**
After test execution, upload reports:

```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```

---

### **5. How do you parallelize test execution in GitHub Actions?**

**Answer:**
Use a **matrix strategy**:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    browser: [chromium, firefox, webkit]
```

---

### **6. What’s the difference between workflow triggers?**

**Answer:**

* **push:** Runs on any push.
* **pull_request:** Runs on PR creation or update.
* **workflow_dispatch:** Manual trigger.

---

### **7. How do you integrate notifications for build failures?**

**Answer:**
Use Slack or email notification actions:

```yaml
- uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1
```

---

### **8. How to run browser tests in a headless CI environment?**

**Answer:**
Install dependencies with `npx playwright install --with-deps` and use `headless: true`.

---

# **Section 3 – Performance / Load Testing**

### **1. What tools can you use for load testing?**

**Answer:**
Common tools: **JMeter**, **k6**, **Locust**, and **Gatling**.

---

### **2. Example: Basic k6 script for API load test**

```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';
export default function () {
  const res = http.get('https://api.example.com/users');
  check(res, { 'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200 });
}
```

---

### **3. What are key metrics in performance testing?**

**Answer:**
**Response time**, **throughput**, **error rate**, **concurrent users**, **latency**, and **percentile response times** (P95, P99).

---

### **4. How do you integrate load tests into CI/CD?**

**Answer:**
Add a job in Jenkins or GitHub Actions to execute the load test script and collect reports before deployment.

---

### **5. Difference between Load, Stress, and Endurance testing**

| Type          | Purpose                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Load**      | Check system behavior under expected load              |
| **Stress**    | Find breaking point by increasing load beyond capacity |
| **Endurance** | Check for performance degradation over time            |
