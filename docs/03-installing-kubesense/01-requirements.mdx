## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the deployment of **Kubesense**, please ensure your system meets the following requirements to avoid any compatibility or installation issues.

### Core Requirements

- **Helm**: Ensure Helm is installed and configured on your local system to manage Kubernetes deployments.
  - *Recommended Version*: Helm 3.x ([Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/))
- **kubectl**: Must be installed and connected to your Kubernetes cluster to enable cluster management and resource configuration.
  - *Recommended Version*: Aligns with your Kubernetes cluster version ([Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/))
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: An operational Kubernetes cluster with **version 1.21+** is required.
- **Node Permissions**: Sufficient permissions to install Helm charts, deploy pods, and manage resources in your Kubernetes cluster.
- **eBPF Support**: Nodes in the Kubernetes cluster must support eBPF, which is available on most modern Linux distributions with kernel version **4.18+**. This enables Kubesense to monitor network traffic and resource utilization effectively.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installing Helm

If Helm is not already installed, you can quickly install it by running:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

After installation, verify that Helm is set up correctly:

```bash
helm version
```

> **Note**: For detailed Helm installation instructions, see the [Helm Documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

## System Compatibility Overview

This section provides detailed compatibility information, including specific Kubernetes environments, supported operating systems, and hardware requirements for deploying Kubesense.

### üöÄ Kubernetes Compatibility

Kubesense requires Kubernetes `v1.21+` to operate effectively. Below is a list of Kubernetes environments that have been tested with Kubesense:

| **K8s Environment** | **Support**                                                           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AKS                 | Supported                                                             |
| EKS                 | Supported (including support on Bottlerocket AMIs)                    |
| EKS Fargate         | Not Supported ([Fargate does not support eBPF](https://github.com/aws/containers-roadmap/issues/1027)) |
| GKE                 | Supported                                                             |
| GKE Autopilot       | Not Supported (Autopilot does not support eBPF)                       |
| OKE                 | Supported                                                             |
| OpenShift           | Supported                                                             |
| Self-hosted         | Supported; verify Linux kernel version for eBPF compatibility         |

### üñ•Ô∏è Operating System Requirements

Kubesense runs exclusively on **Linux nodes**. Ensure your nodes meet the following specifications:

| **OS**   | **Support**   | **Kernel Version**  |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Linux    | Supported     | v4.14+              |

#### Supported Linux Distributions

The following Linux distributions are known to be compatible with Kubesense:

| **Distribution** | **Minimum Version** |
|------------------|---------------------|
| CentOS           | 7.3+               |
| Debian           | 10+                |
| RedHat Enterprise Linux | 8+        |
| Ubuntu           | 16.04+             |

### üß† CPU Architecture Requirements

Kubesense‚Äôs server components require an **x86-64 architecture** to function effectively. However, Kubesense sensors support both x86-64 and ARM architectures, enabling broader compatibility across different hardware platforms.

| **Architecture** | **Support**     |
|------------------|-----------------|
| x86-64           | Supported       |
| ARM              | Supported       |
