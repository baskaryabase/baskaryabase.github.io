title: Setting Context for Kubesense Deployment
---

Before deploying Kubesense in your on-premise Kubernetes environment, it‚Äôs essential to understand the roles of its core components‚Äîthe **server** and **sensor**‚Äîand how they work together to provide full observability into your clusters.

---

## üîç Overview of Kubesense Components

Kubesense consists of two primary components, each serving a specific purpose in the observability process:

### 1. Sensor Components
- **Role**: The sensor component is responsible for data collection within each Kubernetes cluster.
- **Functionality**: Sensors utilize **eBPF** to trace system and network activities, capturing key metrics like:
  - Pod communications
  - Resource utilization (CPU, memory)
  - Network latency and throughput
- **Data Transmission**: The collected data is sent to the Kubesense server for processing and storage.
- **Scalability**: Multiple sensors can be deployed across different clusters, allowing for comprehensive observability in multi-cluster environments.

### 2. Server Components
- **Role**: The server component processes and stores the data received from sensors, providing a central hub for managing observability data.
- **Functionality**: The server aggregates observability information and makes it available through a **dashboard**, where users can visualize and analyze data from the clusters.
- **Centralized Management**: The server acts as the centralized point for managing all clusters and sensors, allowing for streamlined monitoring and analysis.

## üó∫Ô∏è Deployment Context

Kubesense can be deployed in two distinct ways, depending on the observability needs and infrastructure setup of your organization:

- **In-cluster Deployment**: Both the server and sensor components are deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster, simplifying the setup and keeping data collection and visualization within a single cluster.
- **Multi-cluster Deployment**: The server and sensor components are deployed separately, allowing the server to collect and aggregate data from multiple clusters. This approach is ideal for organizations managing multiple Kubernetes clusters.

## üì° Kubesense Sensor: Data Collection

The **sensor** components are deployed within individual Kubernetes clusters and play a key role in collecting real-time observability data. They leverage eBPF for efficient, low-overhead tracing of system-level activities.

### Data Collected by Sensors
Sensors collect a variety of critical metrics, including:
- **Logging**: Collect logs from all cluster components in a unified view.
- **Network Traffic**: Monitors traffic between pods and services.
- **Resource Usage**: Tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage to understand resource consumption.
- **Latency and Throughput**: Captures latency metrics for service communications, aiding in the detection of bottlenecks.

### Key Considerations for Sensor Deployment
- **Communication**: Sensors need secure communication with the server to transmit collected data. Configure network policies or firewalls as necessary to enable this communication.
- **Minimal Overhead**: Designed to operate with minimal performance impact, sensors rely on eBPF for efficient data collection without significant resource drain on the cluster.

## üóÑÔ∏è Kubesense Server: Data Processing and Storage

The **server** component is the central processing hub in Kubesense, receiving data from sensors deployed across clusters and making it accessible to users through a dashboard.

### Server Responsibilities
- **Data Aggregation**: Collects data from multiple sensors, aggregating it for further analysis.
- **Data Storage**: Stores observability data in a database or data warehouse, supporting long-term storage, query capabilities, and data analytics.
- **User Dashboard**: Provides a web-based dashboard for users to visualize metrics, analyze network traffic, and monitor resource usage in real-time.

### Key Considerations for Server Deployment
- **Persistent Storage**: The server requires persistent storage for databases or data warehouses to store large volumes of data.
- **Dashboard Accessibility**: Set up an external hostname or ingress for the Kubesense dashboard, allowing users to access the UI securely.

## üîß Preparing for Deployment

To ensure a successful deployment of Kubesense, follow these guidelines for setting up both sensor and server components:

- **Sensor Setup**:
  - Verify that Kubernetes nodes support eBPF for low-level system tracing.
  - Ensure that network configurations allow secure communication between sensors and the server.

- **Server Setup**:
  - Configure an external hostname or ingress to make the Kubesense dashboard accessible.
  - Allocate persistent storage for data aggregation and retention.

## üìå Next Steps

With a clear understanding of the deployment context, proceed with the installation steps to deploy Kubesense using Helm. Choose a deployment approach based on your observability requirements:

- [Deploy Server and Sensor Together (In-cluster)](./04-install-using/02-helm.mdx#deploy-kubesense-for-in-cluster-deployment)
- [Deploy Server and Sensor Separately (Multi-cluster)](./04-install-using/02-helm.mdx#deploying-server--sensor-separately)

By understanding the roles of each component and setting up the required infrastructure, you‚Äôll be well-prepared to deploy Kubesense effectively and gain comprehensive observability across your Kubernetes clusters.
