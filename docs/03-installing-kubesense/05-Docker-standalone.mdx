# **KubeSense Docker Standalone Installation Guide**

This document explains how to install the KubeSense agent using a standalone Docker setup with the provided `setup.sh` script. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a successful installation.

---

## **Prerequisites**
Before running the installation script, ensure the following:
1. **Docker Installed:** Docker should be installed and running on your system. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if not already set up.
2. **Environment Variable Setup:** The `KUBESENSE_SECRET` environment variable must be set. This secret is required for authentication.

---

## **Installation Steps**

### **Step 1: Set the Environment Variable**
Set the `KUBESENSE_SECRET` environment variable with your secret key before running the script. Replace `<your-secret-key>` with the actual secret.

#### For Linux/MacOS:
```bash
export KUBESENSE_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
```

---

### **Step 2: Run the Installation Script**
Execute the `setup.sh` script to install the KubeSense agent.

#### Command:
```bash
bash <(curl -s -L https://docker.kubesense.ai/setup.sh) sensor
```
   

The script will:
- Pull the required Docker image for the KubeSense agent.
- Configure and run the container with the necessary settings.

---

### **Step 3: Verify the Installation**
After the script completes, verify that the KubeSense agent is running by listing the active Docker containers.

#### Command:
```bash
docker ps
```

You should see the KubeSense container running with details like container ID, image, and status.

## **Troubleshooting**
1. **Missing KUBESENSE_SECRET Error:**
   - Ensure the `KUBESENSE_SECRET` environment variable is correctly set before running the script.

2. **Container Not Running:**
   - Run `docker logs <container_name>` to view logs and diagnose the issue.

3. **Docker Command Not Found:**
   - Verify Docker is installed and running on your machine.

---

## **Additional Information**
- **Required Permissions:** The container runs in privileged mode to enable kernel-level operations like eBPF.
